      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" title="유튜브">In the current study</a>, Wwe  consider a single stock whose costprice  observes
      a switching- geometric Brownian Mmotion  and that it pays no dividends in the
       current study. Given the current price of a stockthe shares, the sellingsold
       axiom is configuredconsists of a target price and a stop -loss limits . A “"
       Ssell"” decisions areis made when the any target price reaches either the ta
       rgetor price setting is reached or the set stop-loss limit is reached. Howeve
       r, in reality, Oone  often picks  up the bad wrong  stock or the purchase ma
       de is at the wrong time in reality.</p>
      <img src="fo1.jpg" width="100%">
       <p>In such casesSo, it is necessary to  sell it sooneras soon as possible  to sto
       p loss. In practice, a target price, is typically    around a gain of 15 % – 5
       5 %–55%  and a stop-loss limit gene</p>

       <p>rally varyvaries from 5 % to 20 %  .   It is, however, not a good idea to ado
       pt uniform profit -taking . Each stock is  different and has it’s own chara
       cteristic, and . Moreocer, it should be treatedhandled  differently with diff
       erent rules of liquidation rules</P>
